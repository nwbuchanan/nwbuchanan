### Who I am
My name is Nathan Buchanan, I am currently a junior at Iowa State University studying Aerospace Engineering. I graduated high school in May of 2015 from a small school in northern Iowa called Northwood-Kensett. While attending Northwood-Kensett high school I actually lived across the state border in Minnesota. In November of 2015 I enlisted in the United States Air Force (USAF) and went to Basic Military Training (BMT) at Lackland. Directly following graduation from BMT I attended follow-on training at Goodfellow Air Force Base where I learned the basics of being an All-Source Intelligence Analyst. Following this I spent the next 3 and a half years at Tinker Air Force Base serving as an All-Source Intelligence Analyst supporting the E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) platform. From Tinker I deployed 3 times supporting missions for Central Command (CENTCOM) and also Southern Command (SOUTHCOM). I seperated from the USAF in November 2019. 

### What I am Insterested in Learning
I am interested in learning the science, engineering, and data analystics involved with hypersonic aircraft performance. I do not have a specific area of hypersonics that I am more interested in, I would like to be involved in and study as many parts as possible of hypersonic aircraft as possible. Particular areas of interest would include; propulsion, fluid dynamics, control surfaces and maneuverability of the aircraft.

### What I am Working on Currently
Right now I am not working on an special projects. I am attempting to secure an internship or possibly a Co-Op sometimes between this Summer and my Senior Year. Other than that I am working towards getting a Bachelor Degree in Aerospace Engineering and a Minor in Data Science.

### Current Hobbies
I really don't have any major hobbies at the moment. I am married and my wife works and lives near Omaha Nebraska, at Offutt Air Force Base while I live in Ames Iowa. Travelling back and forth takes a good portion of my time. Other than that I am attempting to get back into decent shape and am trying to go to the gym 6 days a week. I also enjoy golfing in the late Spring, Summer, and Fall. My wife and I also really enjoy travelling and seeing the different National and State Parks the United States has to offer.
